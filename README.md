My project is a Makeup app that gives you vegan and cruelty free makeup
The app on the main page sorts out makeup by face foundation, lips etc, on the brands page there is a search bar where users can search for products and their brands. I have also made two pop ups, one displaying a marketing pop up and one displaying a key pop up(This is because my crueltyfree cards are purple and vegan are green). I have made a favourites page which half works. If the pages are hearted they are displayed in the favourites page. However I cannot seem to stop the heartFill from changing between renders. I have tried using usecallback,useEffect,useMemo, creating my own custom hook, putting my state variable elsewhere and the issue is still persistent.
